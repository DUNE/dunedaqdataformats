# dunedaqdataformats
Offline-versioned copies of DUNE-DAQ/daqdataformats

This repository contains versioned copies of header files used to define the data formats used by the DUNE DAQ.  Due to evolution of the formats and the need for the DUNE Offline to support reading and processing of all current and older data, all versions of these classes need to be available to all offline jobs at any time.  ROOT provides tools for automatically migrating from one version of a class to another when reading data from files, but HDF5 does not.  This repository therefore contains directories labeled by version number to maintain each version of the header files.
